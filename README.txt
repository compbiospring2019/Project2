Usage Instructions

Linux and Windows instructions:
To run this program, unzip our project. Change directories
to our project directory (the directory containing main.py).
Then, to train the decision tree, enter

python train_and_evaluate.py <fasta_directory> <sa_directory>

in the command line, where fasta_directory is the directory with
the fasta files and sa_directory is the directory with
the sa files for training and evaluating. If your python executable
has a different name, use that name instead of 'python'. Paths
were tested with absolute paths, enclosed in double quotes.
